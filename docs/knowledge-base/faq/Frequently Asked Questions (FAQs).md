# **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

Here are some common questions about theBlockchain.ai to help you understand our mission and platform.

## **General & Core Vision**

### **1\. What is the core mission of theBlockchain.ai?**

The core mission of theBlockchain.ai is to build the economic layer for open-source and trusted AI, fostering a transparent, secure, and collaborative ecosystem where AI's true potential is unlocked on the blockchain. We aim for a Win/Win/Win for developers, businesses, and data owners.

### **2\. How does theBlockchain.ai ensure trust in AI models and data?**

theBlockchain.ai ensures trust through the integration of blockchain technology, which provides verifiable provenance, immutability, transparency, and auditability for AI models, their lifecycle, and data usage. This creates an unchangeable record that mitigates risks and builds confidence.

### **7\. How does theBlockchain.ai address challenges like data silos and "black box" AI models?**

theBlockchain.ai addresses data silos by enabling secure federated learning, allowing collaborative intelligence without centralized data pooling. It tackles "black box" AI concerns by providing verifiable and auditable AI through blockchain's immutable records, ensuring transparency of model provenance and usage.

### **9\. What is Federated Learning and how does it relate to theBlockchain.ai?**

Federated Learning is a machine learning technique that trains algorithms across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers, keeping data local and private. theBlockchain.ai incorporates Secure Federated Learning as part of its core vision to enable collaborative AI development while guaranteeing privacy and data security.

### **10\. How is theBlockchain.ai positioned competitively against existing AI or blockchain platforms?**

theBlockchain.ai establishes an unassailable strategic position by uniquely integrating blockchain's trust and auditability with a dynamic AI marketplace and custom automation solutions. This convergence creates powerful network effects, a data advantage, and high barriers to entry that differentiate it from fragmented centralized AI platforms and general blockchain solutions.

## **For Developers**

### **4\. How do developers get paid for their code on your platform?**

Developers get paid directly for their code "OUTPUT" through automated smart contracts on the platform. This ensures fair and prompt compensation as their AI modules are utilized, eliminating intermediaries.

### **8\. Is the intellectual property (IP) of AI models protected on the platform?**

Yes, robust IP protection mechanisms are a core feature. Blockchain technology provides an indelible, timestamped record of authorship for software and digital assets, and smart contracts facilitate secure intellectual property management, including copyrights and automated licensing.

## **For Businesses & Commerce**

### **3\. What is 'The OUTPUT Marketplace' and who is it for?**

'The OUTPUT Marketplace' is a unified developer marketplace designed to foster a vibrant AI ecosystem. It's for developers to efficiently publish and monetize their AI automation modules, and for businesses and researchers to easily discover, evaluate, and integrate trustworthy AI solutions.

### **5\. What are 'Code-In-Action (CIA)' solutions?**

'Code-In-Action (CIA)' refers to our A La Carte model for **C**ustom, **I**ntelligent **A**utomation (CIA). These solutions leverage vetted modules available from The OUTPUT Marketplace to address specific and complex business needs.

## **For Token & Investors**

### **6\. How does the $BAI Token fit into the ecosystem?**

The $BAI Token is the native token that underpins the entire economic ecosystem of theBlockchain.ai. It is designed to be used for transactions, staking, and governance within The OUTPUT Marketplace, creating a deep economic moat.
